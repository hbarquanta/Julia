# Julia Tutorials Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Julia Tutorials Repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of tutorials designed to help you master the Julia programming language. The tutorials are divided into three levels: Basics, Intermediate, and Expert. Each level is available in both Jupyter Notebook and Pluto.jl formats, providing you with flexible learning options.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Julia, we recommend starting with the Julia Basics tutorial. For those who are already familiar with the basics, you can dive into the Intermediate and Expert tutorials. Each tutorial is designed to build upon the previous one, progressively introducing more advanced concepts and techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
